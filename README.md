# .NET Skills Assessment

This repository contains all the instructions for a quick (60min tops) assessment of skills for a .NET software developer.
The purpose of the assessment is to serve as an evaluation of skills a .NET developer should have.

The assessment will be updated as needed to keep up with changes in the .NET ecosystem.

## Activity 1 - Git Evaluation

1. Create a new file called `assessment.md`
2. For each of the items below, create a header section and write a small answer about it.
3. After you complete each section, commit the changes.

### Sections
* **Development Experience** - What technologies do you know?
* **Git Commands** - What are your favorite git commands?
* **Continuing Education** - How do you learn new things?

Once you're done with these sections, merge back into the `master` branch as a single commit.

Go to the `fizz-buzz` branch for instructions on the next activity.
